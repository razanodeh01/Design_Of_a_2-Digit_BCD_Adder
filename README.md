<h2>Design and Verification of a 2-Digit BCD Adder</h2>
<P>*************************************************************************</P>
<p> This project involves the creation and verification of a 2-Digit Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) Adder using two design approaches: Ripple Carry and Carry Look-Ahead. The design, implemented with basic gates, undergoes two stages. Stage 1 focuses on Ripple Carry, emphasizing functional verification, latency determination, and error handling. In Stage 2, the design transitions to Carry Look-Ahead, showcasing improved performance. </p>
